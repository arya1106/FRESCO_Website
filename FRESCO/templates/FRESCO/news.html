                        <h5>Anvil Architecture Summary</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">The Anvil cluster comprises 1000 CPU nodes with the 3rd generation AMD EPYC
                            "Milan" processor and 100 Gbps HDR Infiniband interconnect.
                            A separate sub-cluster comprises 16 GPU nodes with four NVIDIA A100 (40GB) GPUs each.
                            Each CPU node has 256 GB DDR4-3200 memory, while the GPU nodes have 512 GB of memory.

                            Further details of Anvil's architecture and job queues can be found in the <a
